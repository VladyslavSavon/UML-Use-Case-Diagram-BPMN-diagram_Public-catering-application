The Public Catering Application: UML Use Case diagram and BPMN diagram

## Short description

The Public Catering Application is a nutrition management system designed for public educational institutions, such as schools and universities. Its primary goal is to streamline the process of ordering food from public canteens, making it more convenient for students to access healthy meals while reducing wait times, improving canteen planning, and enhancing transparency in spending.

The system enables students to order meals through a mobile application and make online payments. Additionally, it helps canteens optimize ingredient usage, ensuring efficiency in meal preparation.

For this project, I have created two diagrams: a UML Use Case diagram and a BPMN diagram.
